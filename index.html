<h1>Claire Ambler Weddings</h1>

<p>
I am an enthusiastic and energetic individual who loves weddings and organisation, and specialise in weddings and events offering a personal service and great attention to detail with a smile.</p> 

<p>
My fees are based on a daily rate and you can always assume about 10-15% of your total wedding budget will be spent in the planning. An average wedding in 2016 is in the region of 21k with around 250 to 300 hours depending on the complexity of the wedding and your requirements. 
</p>

<p>
You will also be dealing with up to an average of around 15 suppliers to coordinate.  I have the pleasure of working with some great suppliers across the UK specifically in the Home Counties where I am based. I work with these local, reliable and cost effective suppliers to source the right supplier that suits you .
</p>

<p>
I am all about cost saving and being efficient and I can help you to avoid the huge markups and unnecessary spend that usually appear when you mention the work 'wedding'!  I can work with you as much or as little as you like, from total wedding management, 8 weeks leading up towards the wedding or just 'on the day management, the choice is yours.  
</p>

<p>
I offer a free of charge no obligation Consultation to met with you to decide if you think we can work together, after all, hiring a wedding coordinator is all about the relationship and trust. 
</p>

<p>
I always pride myself in offering you 100% commitment and support from the outset to build your dream wedding day. I am here to relieve you of the stress and anxiety of all the planning, allowing you to concentrate on the fun elements of your  wedding day. I will work with you to understand what you would like your day to be like getting to know you and your partner is a key part of my role to enable me to deliver the day you have dreamed of.
